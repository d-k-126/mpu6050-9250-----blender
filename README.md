# Research and Development of a Wearable Device for Gait Simulation and Analysis

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a wearable system for gait simulation and analysis. The system utilizes ESP32 microcontrollers and multiple MPU6050 sensors to capture motion data, process it, and transmit it to Blender for real-time visualization. The goal is to aid in medical diagnostics, health monitoring, and motion research.
